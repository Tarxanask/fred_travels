# 2025-04-10 14:47:20.476264
+i think we are using only 3 templates, touritsinfo.html contacts.html and gallery.html as the main page so you should remove all other templates which are unnecessary and rename one of the templates to index (may be gallery) so that i do not face that issue when i host in git hub pages if i am right

+should i choose anythin from here to host this website in netlify Build settings
+Specify how Netlify will build your site. Learn more in the docs
+
+Branch to deploy
+main
+Base directory
+The directory where Netlify installs dependencies and runs your build command.
+
+Build command
+Examples: jekyll build, gulp build, make all
+
+Publish directory
+Examples: _site, dist, public
+
+Functions directory
+netlify/functions
+Example: my_functions

# 2025-04-10 15:08:46.758999
+The error "Page not found" happens on Netlify because it's trying to access a route like:
+
+arduino
+Копировать
+Редактировать
+https://your-site.netlify.app/touristinfo.html
+but Netlify is treating it like a dynamic route, not a static file.
+
+Solution 1  Correct way to link pages:
+Make sure your links in index.html (and other pages) look like this:
+
+html
+Копировать
+Редактировать
+<a href="touristinfo.html">Tourist Info</a>
+<a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>
+Don't use:
+
+html
+Копировать
+Редактировать
+<a href="/touristinfo">Tourist Info</a>
+or
+
+html
+Копировать
+Редактировать
+<a href="touristinfo">Tourist Info</a>
+Solution 2  Netlify Redirects (Best practice for SPA)
+If you're using a Single Page Application (SPA) (like React, Vue), then you'd need a _redirects file in your root folder with this content:
+
+bash
+Копировать
+Редактировать
+/*    /index.html   200
+But since your project is a static HTML site  this is not needed unless you're using clean URLs.
+
+Solution 3  Check File Locations
+Ensure that your file structure is exactly like in your repo:
+
+diff
+Копировать
+Редактировать
+- index.html
+- contact.html
+- touristinfo.html
+No subfolders for these unless you reference them properly.
+
+Solution 4  Netlify Settings Check
+When deploying:
+
+Build Command: (empty)  since it's a static site.
+
+Publish Directory: set it to the root folder where your index.html is located.
+
+Example:
+
+Копировать
+Редактировать
+tripboss_travelagency_site_html_css_js-master/    Consider all of this and modify our website

+can you unite all of this html templates into one so that at the end we will have only one page, with dynamic buttons at the top, so now each page has those buttons on the top gallery tousit info and contact, i want you to leave those buttons but when we press them we should not redirect to the new page but go to the lower side of our new united only page the structure of which is starts from tourist info, gallery and contacts
